<h3>Block Class</h3>

<p>The block class was intended to be the underlying data structure of our BombStar game. 
Our application's MainWindow would have a two dimensional array of Block objects, corresponding 
to the game board with the same number of elements in each. Each individual Block object would
contain pointer references to four adjacent Blocks. For example, if a Block could be accessed in
the main window with indexes x and y, the Block would contain the pointer references of the Blocks 
at indexes (x+1,y) (x-1,y) (x, y+1) (x, y-1). This allows some of our functions to be recursive 
functions at the Block level instead of adding more to our main window through accessing arrays. 
The Block also contained a CoordX and CoordY value. These were the same accessing indexes at the
Block level. In many cases, many Blocks will be contained in a vector<Block*>, and to have constant
time access to that Block's neighbors in MainWindow, the coordinates of the Block needed to be 
easily obtained. </p>

<p>The block class itself was not implemented with a graphical representation. Because we were 
using two dimensional arrays as well as a multi-directional list at the Block level, we wanted 
to establish the Block objects and swap values for bookkeeping instead of removing and creating
new Blocks every single time a collection of Blocks was graphically removed and needing to re-establish the Block data structures. After we switched 
to the 8x9 game board, the block class was changed to only include numerical values instead of 
graphical representations and the myRectItem class would contain all of the graphical implementations. </p>

<p>Along with separating the data structures and the graphical representation, we devised a system
that mapped an integer value to a QColor. More on this is written in the Colors Class, but the 
Block Class only contains an integer value for easy color comparisons. The same integer value between
Blocks means those Blocks have the same color. This was also applied to representing stars on the 
Blocks as well. A graphImage of 0 meant that no star was being graphically represented on that particular
Block, a graphImage of 2 meant that a star was represented on that Block. The intent was to include
bombs (now stars), as well as arrows but there wasn't enough time to properly implement arrows. 
The extra arrows would have had graphImage values of 3 and 4 for vertical and horizontal, and potentially
5 for all four directions. </p>

<p>Most of the Block functions are simple accessor or mutator functions. The only functions needing 
a more detailed explanation are foundMatch and gatherBlocks, and they will be explained in Game Play.
markedBool and coloredBool are used in many of these algorithms and will be detailed there as well.
